	abstract = {The following systematic review strives to explore the mere integration of ChatGPT within mathematics education, analyzing its impact on teacher assistance and student learning. Google Scholar was utilized as the primary database due to its extensive coverage of academic articles and journals in various disciplines. Through the following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) framework, thirty-one studies are evaluated through thematic analysis table. The findings revealed that ChatGPT’s potential is dynamic and versatile when it comes to improving personalized learning, and student engagement. Specifically, the findings suggest that the incorporation of ChatGPT offers diversified responses, facilitating lesson planning, student support and answering questions. Additional findings indicate that ChatGPT lead to improvements in learning motivations among students, however, it does struggle to answer complicated or difficult mathematical questions which showcase limitations in specific topics such as spatial geometry and derivatives. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is often regarded as providing a ‘soft start’ for later involvement with artificial intelligence and, hence, as a crucial twenty-first century skill. The introduction of CT in primary mathematics curricula puts many demands on teachers, and their understanding of CT in mathematics is key to its successful introduction. Inspired by an information ecology perspective, we investigate how four primary school teachers understand CT in mathematics and how they go ahead to include CT in their mathematics teaching practice. Through observations and interviews, we find promising starting points for including CT, related to pattern recognition, problem solving and the use of programming activities. Our findings indicate that teachers’ lack of knowledge affects CT adoption in two ways: during its inclusion in the existing mathematics curriculum and as a new element focussed on programming and coding, leaving mathematics in the background. For the inclusion to be fruitful, we suggest there is a need to help teachers understand how CT can be used productively in mathematics and vice versa. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Mostly for the education information analysis in the class of mathematics in the university, it should be based on a big data-driven system to promote the quality of teaching in the classroom. In the method of teaching math in university, teachers should take full advantage of the benefits of a big data-driven system powered by AI, grow a good teaching model for students, promote education through big data, progressively teach students according to their aptitude, develop in a tailored direction, increase teaching quality and effectiveness, and finally create more great talents for our country. For the sake of improving the resource sharing and the management level of the curriculum which teaches advanced knowledge about mathematics teaching, based on a particle swarm optimization algorithm, an advanced math teaching system is proposed in this paper. The fusion model that can be used in the teaching process of math in university is constructed, the adaptive scheduling of the curriculum which teaches advanced knowledge about mathematics auxiliary teaching resources is realized by an optimization algorithm used for fusion particle swarm, the autocorrelation feature of the curriculum which teaches advanced knowledge about mathematics auxiliary teaching resources is extracted, and the adaptive optimization of the curriculum which teaches advanced knowledge about mathematics auxiliary teaching resource fusion is realized by fuzzy correlation feature matching and statistical analysis.

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) that power chatbots such as ChatGPT have capabilities across numerous domains. Teachers and students have been increasingly using chatbots in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in various ways, including for assessment purposes. However, there has been a lack of systematic investigation into LLMs’ capabilities and limitations in automatically generating items for STEM subject assessments, especially given that LLMs can hallucinate and may risk promoting misconceptions and hindering conceptual understanding. To address this, we systematically investigated LLMs' conceptual understanding and quality of working in generating question and answer pairs across various STEM subjects. We used prompt engineering on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with three different approaches: standard prompting, standard prompting with added chain-of-thought prompting using worked examples with steps, and the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language. The questions and answer pairs were generated at the pre-university level in the three STEM subjects of chemistry, physics, and mathematics and evaluated by subject-matter experts. We found that LLMs generated quality questions when using the chain-of-thought prompting for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and when using the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 overall. However, there were varying patterns in generating multistep answers, with differences in final answer and intermediate step accuracy. An interesting finding was that the chain-of-thought prompting with coding language for GPT-4 significantly outperformed the other approaches in generating correct final answers while demonstrating moderate accuracy in generating multistep answers correctly. In addition, through qualitative analysis, we identified domain-specific prompting patterns across the three STEM subjects. We then discussed how our findings aligned with, contradicted, and contributed to the current body of knowledge on automatic item generation research using LLMs, and the implications for teachers using LLMs to generate STEM assessment items. © 2024 The Authors},

ChatGPT was also given the same problem to solve with various prompts, and the correctness of its solutions and problem-solving strategies were assessed alongside those of PSTs. The results indicated that PSTs used diverse strategies and achieved accurate solutions, but not always relevant strategies to children’s level of understanding. ChatGPT employed similar strategies to PSTs but mostly produced incorrect solutions, and its performance needed to be contextualized in the primary school context.

Learning Management Systems (LMS) have gained increasing popularity, particularly in higher education, due to their ability to manage teacher–student interactions. These systems store valuable information which describes students’ behaviour throughout a course. These data can be utilised to construct statistical models that represent learner behaviour within an online LMS platform. In this study, we aim to compare different sources of information and, more ambitiously, to provide insights into which source of information is most valuable for inferring student performance. The considered sets of information come from (i) the Moodle LMS; (ii) socio-economic data about students acquired from a survey; and (iii) subject marks achieved throughout the course. To determine the relevance of the incorporated information, we use artificial intelligence (AI) methods, and we report the importance measures of four state-of-the-art methods.

This exploration aims to use the new teaching concept and realize a high-quality teaching effect in quality education. First, the ability-oriented Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education is expounded from the four aspects of ability objectives, students, projects, and teaching system construction, and the ability-oriented STEAM graded teaching system is proposed. Second, using the primary school stage as an example, combined with the thinking advanced path of cognitive psychology and the Primary School Science Curriculum Standard of Compulsory Education, a four-dimensional STEAM graded teaching system of "ability, knowledge, project, and evaluation"guided by innovative ability and involved with other abilities is constructed. Third, the shaping path and specific implementation strategies of the system are analysed. Finally, the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model is used to evaluate the effect of STEAM graded teaching. The results show that the accuracy of students' answers in the proposed STEAM graded teaching method is significantly higher than that in the traditional teaching method, and the evaluation error of the BPNN model is less than 1%, proving that the BPNN model has good calculation accuracy and can be used to evaluate the effect of STEAM graded teaching. This exploration provides a reference for the practice of STEAM education in China.  © 2022 Yuanwu Shi and Lijuan Rao.},

Logo, the first computer language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices. © 2020 Owner/Author.},

	abstract = {This research investigates how secondary school mathematics educators in the Nsukka Education Zone, Enugu State, Nigeria, perceive the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based ChatGPT into teaching mathematics. The study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods strategy, starting with a systematic survey and followed by detailed interviews. The Mathematics Teachers’ Awareness and Perceptions of AI-based ChatGPT Questionnaire (MTAPACQ) used in this study was adapted from an existing online survey and administered to 80 mathematics teachers, who were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure varied representation across different local government areas. The survey explored teachers’ awareness, utilisation, and perceptions of ChatGPT. Following the quantitative phase, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of five teachers who were familiar with ChatGPT to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings indicate limited awareness of ChatGPT, with only 17% demonstrating familiarity with the technology. The infrequent utilisation of ChatGPT in mathematics teaching is mainly associated with this limited awareness. Teachers who integrate ChatGPT report positive outcomes, including improved teaching effectiveness, heightened student engagement, and enhanced comprehension of complex concepts. Nevertheless, the overall perceptions of the tool’s impact on mathematics teaching and learning are moderate. The identified challenges in relation to integration include technical adaptability, curriculum alignment, and the need for customisation to accommodate diverse learning styles. This study emphasises the significance of continuous professional development and ongoing support for teachers to integrate AI-based ChatGPT into mathematics instruction proficiently. The insights derived from the findings hold value for educators, policymakers, and technology developers aspiring to elevate the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics education. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Education and training are among the fields taking advantage of serious games (SGs). In this article, we present Gea 2: A New Earth, a digital SG developed as an immersive 3-D virtual learning environment, integrating several educational resources, including multimedia learning material, communication tools, and intelligent tutoring support. The game aims to complement traditional classroom activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), for high school students and teachers. It incorporates an intelligent pedagogical agent that can converse in natural language with the student and provides unsolicited hints during gameplay. This article presents the game and its evaluation based on experiments involving about 100 participants. We think that the results presented here add to the research on game-based learning for STEM, by proposing a complex game system, where artificial intelligence techniques are integrated to support students' learning, and by confirming that the game experience can be attractive for the learners, also in very constrained classroom environments, such as those we operated in. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},
